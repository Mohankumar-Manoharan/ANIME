            <p>"I remember the first time I saw him — quiet, humble, and barely holding himself together in a world that had already written him off. They called him weak, disposable. But even then, there was something different in his eyes — not pride,
                not anger... something deeper. I watched him fall, and then I watched him rise — not as the man they mocked, but as a force they now fear. He walks through dungeons like death itself, his shadows swallowing entire armies. And yet, in the
                silence between battles, when no one’s watching, I see it — the same quiet boy, still carrying the weight of the world, all alone. I don’t know whether to reach for him... or to stand back in awe.
